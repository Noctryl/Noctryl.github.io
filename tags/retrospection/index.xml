      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom’s voice came from the kitchen, cutting through the silence of the afternoon. Sharp. Matter-of-fact. The kind of voice that doesn’t expect pushback, just compliance. I could hear the &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt; of the knife against the cutting board as she made sabji for the night. Onions, probably. The smell of them frying in hot oil drifted into the room — that acidic, pungent smell that fills the entire house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
