      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:40 AM — This Morning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sound came before consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wake up, Aarav. It&amp;rsquo;s 8:40. You&amp;rsquo;re too late for coaching.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;rsquo;s voice. Not gentle. Not kind. Just factual. The voice of someone who has called out the same name at the same time too many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I jolted awake. The kind of jolt where your entire body tenses at once. Where adrenaline floods through you in an instant. My eyes opened but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus. The numbers on my alarm clock were swimming. 8:40. Eight. Four. Zero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom’s voice came from the kitchen, cutting through the silence of the afternoon. Sharp. Matter-of-fact. The kind of voice that doesn’t expect pushback, just compliance. I could hear the &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt; of the knife against the cutting board as she made sabji for the night. Onions, probably. The smell of them frying in hot oil drifted into the room — that acidic, pungent smell that fills the entire house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
