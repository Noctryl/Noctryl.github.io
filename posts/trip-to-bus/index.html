<p>“Wake up, Aarav! It’s getting late for your coaching.”
The same sentence that’s echoed through my ears every morning for the past months — almost like a repeating alarm in my life. My eyelids refused to open, my body stiff. The fan above me moved lazily, stirring the air that still carried the dull warmth of the night. The blanket felt heavier than usual, trapping me in that thin line between dream and disappointment.</p>
<p>I was still half asleep — or maybe half alive — irritated and moody, mostly because I’d slept late again. Another failed late-night study session, another round of promises broken. The notes from last night still lay open on my table, the pen resting exactly where I had given up. The pages looked like they’d been waiting for me to finish the physics numerical I was solving — but I never did.</p>
<p>It took me nearly ten minutes to gather enough will to leave the bed. I sat up, rubbing my face, feeling the fatigue crawl through my bones, it felt immensely tiring. There’s no real motivation left to go to coaching. I hate it — not out of hate against teachers, but out of exhaustion. Sitting there for hours, pretending to understand while others confidently answer — it feels like a slow humiliation I’ve paid a huge sum for. Funny how the place that’s supposed to shape my future feels like the last place I want to be.</p>
<p>“8:45,” the clock blinked as I stepped out of the bathroom, my hair still wet and dripping onto the floor.
I was already five minutes late. “Mummy, serve the breakfast!” I shouted from my room, tugging on my coaching T-shirt and trying to find my socks that always went missing on mornings like this.</p>
<p>I caught my reflection in the mirror and paused. My face looked thinner — maybe weaker is the right word. Not that I was healthy before, but JEE has a way of draining you that even hunger can’t. The eyes were puffed, hair thinner than last month. I noticed the strands clinging to my comb again. It worried me, yes — but I didn’t have the energy to care anymore. I was late. Again.</p>
<p>“Mummy, is breakfast ready?” I called out.
“Go do pooja, sabzi will take five minutes,” she replied calmly.</p>
<p>Something inside me snapped for a second. Five minutes — I didn’t have five minutes. I wanted to argue, to say Mummy, I don’t have time for pooja! but stopped halfway. My irritation has been a new ability I discovered in myself lately. I could feel it coming up again.</p>
<p>“Patience, Aarav,” I muttered. “Have some fucking patience.”
I took a breath and went to the pooja room anyway. The faint burning matchstick filled the air. A small diya flickered beside the Ganeshji, casting a soft moving shadow on the walls. I closed my eyes for a second — not out of devotion, but out of exhaustion. The silence there felt different. Safe, maybe. Then, reality returned. I was late.</p>
<p>By 9:00, I was gulping down the paratha. “Eat slowly, aarav!” my mother said from the kitchen.
“I’m late already!” I replied, mouth full.
She sighed, and I could sense the disappointment in her silence. That silence always says more than words could.</p>
<p>9:08 — I finally stepped out of the house. The moment I opened the gate, the air hit my face — softer, cooler, like someone had lowered the temperature of the entire world overnight. Winter was sneaking into North India. The sun hadn’t fully woken yet — pale, colorless.</p>
<p>The lane was quieter than usual. Even the tea stall near the corner hadn’t fully come alive yet. The air smelled faintly of ginger and disappointment. Pretty much absurd way to describe it. The city was still half-asleep, and for a moment, I wished I could be too.</p>
<p>I checked my phone again- it said 9:10. I had five minutes to cover 400m. My bag bounced against my back as I started walking faster. The road felt longer than usual. My shoes made fast movements.</p>
<p>At 9:13, I was still 200 metres away. My legs were heavy, my breath uneven, but running with the uniform on would look awkward. I quickened my pace anyway. The bus horn pierced through the quiet — long, impatient, like it was mocking my effort. The air around me felt heavy.</p>
<p>At 9:15 sharp, I reached. The orange electric bus stood there, engine growling softly, almost unwillingly. I smiled faintly. “Yeah, I get it,” I thought, “I don’t want to move either.”</p>
<p>My favourite seat — the one by the window where the cool air hits your face just right — was already taken. That stung a bit more than it should have. Felt poetic somehow. I ended up in the front row, resting my head against the seat in front.</p>
<p>As the bus began to move, I looked out at the blur of passing streets, the sunlight flickering between the trees. I took a slow breath. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I was lost. Maybe I was both.
So I took out my phone and began to write — because somehow, putting my thoughts into words felt like the only thing I could still control.</p>
