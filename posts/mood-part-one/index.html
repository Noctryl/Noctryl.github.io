        <p>“Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.”</p>
<p>My mom’s voice came from the kitchen, cutting through the silence of the afternoon. Sharp. Matter-of-fact. The kind of voice that doesn’t expect pushback, just compliance. I could hear the <em>thunk</em> of the knife against the cutting board as she made sabji for the night. Onions, probably. The smell of them frying in hot oil drifted into the room — that acidic, pungent smell that fills the entire house.</p>
<p>It was nothing. Five seconds of work. Walk to the kitchen, grab the leftover container, throw it in the bin. Lock the front door. Five seconds. Maybe ten if I was moving slowly.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even studying. I wasn’t in the middle of anything important. I was just sitting there. Just&hellip; existing. Doing nothing in particular.</p>
<p>But I felt it anyway. A spike. A quick, hot rise of irritation that came from nowhere.</p>
<p>The strange part wasn’t the irritation itself. The strange part was that I could <em>see</em> it happening to me. Like I was watching myself from outside my own body, observing as irritation bloomed in my chest for absolutely no reason. And knowing — fully, completely knowing — that this irritation made no sense. That I had no right to feel it. That my mom wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable.</p>
<p>But there it was anyway. Hot and sharp and ready to snap.</p>
<p>So I stopped. I didn’t move. I didn’t throw the leftover. I didn’t lock the door. I just sat there, feeling this irritation pulse through me, and I thought: <em>This doesn’t make sense. This anger isn’t about this moment. This is about something else. This is about something that happened before this moment. Multiple moments, maybe. Let me find it.</em></p>
<p>Because I’ve learned something about myself. When irritation shows up for no reason, it’s never actually no reason. It’s always the tip of something much larger. It’s the surface breaking. It’s the pressure finding a crack.</p>
<p>So I needed to go back. To trace this thing to its root.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="200-am--the-night-before">2:00 AM — The Night Before</h2>
<p>Let me tell you about 2:00 AM.</p>
<p>I was lying in bed, but not the way people lie in bed when they’re about to sleep. I was propped up on pillows, the blue light of my phone casting strange shadows across my face. My room was dark except for that glow. The fan above me was moving lazily, pushing the warm night air around in circles, accomplishing nothing.</p>
<p>I was scrolling.</p>
<p>Not YouTube Shorts — those move too fast, give you too much of a hit too quickly. Not Instagram — at least that has structure, people you know, things that mean something. Just&hellip; scrolling. Through news apps, through random articles I didn’t care about, through threads of conversations I’d never read to the end. My thumb kept moving on its own, muscle memory more than intention.</p>
<p><em>Doomscrolling.</em> That’s what they call it. I didn’t know the term until someone mentioned it, but the moment I heard it, I recognised myself. The act of scrolling through information you don’t want to consume, looking for something you can’t name, getting gradually more depressed with each swipe. That was me. That was what I was doing.</p>
<p>My eyes were tired but my brain was wired — that weird state where your body wants to sleep but your mind is too restless, too hungry for stimulation. So the phone kept glowing. My thumb kept moving. The hours kept passing.</p>
<p>I was scrolling because I was avoiding. Because if I wasn’t scrolling, I’d have to think about the day I’d just wasted. I’d have to think about tomorrow. I’d have to think about JEE and coaching and all the things I’m not doing. So I scrolled. I let my brain absorb meaningless information instead. It felt safer.</p>
<p>But eventually, even that got old.</p>
<p>I was tired of scrolling — actually tired, bone-tired — so I threw my phone onto the bed beside me. It bounced against the blanket with a soft <em>thud.</em> The screen stayed on for a moment, illuminating the small corner of my room, then dimmed to black.</p>
<p>That’s when I saw it — the note on my study table.</p>
<p>It was just a small piece of paper, stuck to the corner of my desk with a piece of tape. Ordinary. The kind of thing I’ve made a hundred times. But in that moment, with my tired eyes and my empty mind, I saw it with a clarity I usually don’t have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today’s study target”</p></blockquote>
<p>I felt it before I even got up to read it — that feeling, heavy and sinking, like something had shifted in my chest. A weight settling. Not sudden — gradual. The way fog settles, the way disappointment settles, the way truth settles.</p>
<p>I got up and walked to the table. My room was cold now. My body moved slowly, like I was walking through water. I read the note.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“10PM–12AM (Physics backlog)”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those words.<br>
Those specific words punched me in the gut. Not metaphorically — actually, physically. I felt the punch. It was like someone had reached into my chest and squeezed.</p>
<p>Because that note — that simple, ordinary note — it showed me exactly who I am. Not who I want to be. Not who I promise myself I’ll be tomorrow. But who I actually am: someone who writes down study targets and then doesn’t follow them. Someone who makes plans and watches himself abandon them. Someone who has discovered the skill of lying to himself on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I stood there, staring at those words. <em>“Physics backlog.”</em> Two words that contained months of falling behind. Chapters I haven’t finished. Concepts I don’t understand. A gap that gets wider every day.</p>
<p>And I thought: <em>I’m weak. I’m so fucking weak.</em></p>
<p>Not in an emotional way. In a factual way. In the way you observe a fact about the world. The sky is blue. Water is wet. I am weak-willed.</p>
<p>The numbness started then — a cold, spreading numbness that began at the base of my skull and moved downward, like ice water being poured through my veins. It was almost a relief, actually. Better than feeling the sadness. Numbness is quieter.</p>
<p>But it didn’t last.</p>
<p>Because in that numbness, my mind started to wander. To imagine. To catastrophise. <em>What if I fail JEE? What happens then? What if all of this — all these months of coaching, all this pressure, all these promises — what if it amounts to absolutely nothing? What if I’m just not capable? What if I’m fundamentally broken in some way?</em></p>
<p>The thoughts spiralled. Each one feeding the next. Each one darker than the last.</p>
<p>And then, in the middle of that spiral, something shifted again. A moment of determination broke through. I stood up straighter. I told myself: <em>Enough. Enough of this. It’s time to sleep. Tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow I’ll actually do it. I’ll actually study. I’ll change.</em></p>
<p>It’s crazy how quickly a mood can cycle through all of these versions of itself — from numbness to sadness to desperation to determination. Like channels on a TV, clicking from one to the next. And I was just sitting there, watching myself feel all of these things, one after another, not sure which one was real.</p>
<p>I noticed something in that moment. Some small observation about myself — about how my mood was shifting and changing and cycling — but then I pushed it away. It seemed unimportant. I was too tired to think about it. Too tired to analyse.</p>
<p>So I went to bed. Around 3:00 AM. With the guilt of a wasted day sitting on my chest like a physical weight. With thoughts about the future pressing against my skull. With promises to myself that felt hollow even as I made them.</p>
<p><em>Five hours until the alarm.</em></p>
