        <p>8:40 AM — This Morning</p>
<p>The sound came before consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Aarav. It&rsquo;s 8:40. You&rsquo;re too late for coaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s voice. Not gentle. Not kind. Just factual. The voice of someone who has called out the same name at the same time too many times before.</p>
<p>I jolted awake. The kind of jolt where your entire body tenses at once. Where adrenaline floods through you in an instant. My eyes opened but I couldn&rsquo;t focus. The numbers on my alarm clock were swimming. 8:40. Eight. Four. Zero.</p>
<p>Late.</p>
<p>Already late. Before the day had even started.</p>
<p>I moved in a blur of panic. My body didn&rsquo;t wait for my mind to catch up. I threw off the blanket—it was tangled around my legs, damp with sweat from the night—and stumbled toward the bathroom. The tile was cold against my feet. I could see myself in the mirror for just a moment: hair sticking up, face puffy with sleep, eyes confused.</p>
<p>Brush. Water on face. Water in mouth. Spit. Rinse. The taste of toothpaste mixing with the stale taste of my own mouth. Everything moving fast. Everything urgent.</p>
<p>Clothes. Shirt. Where&rsquo;s my shirt? There. I grabbed it and pulled it on without fully thinking about it. The fabric was tight against my chest. My heart was still racing.</p>
<p>By the time I made it to the bus-stop, My shirt was soaked in sweat. There was sweat running down my temples. My breath was heavy and uneven, like I&rsquo;d been running instead of just rushing through my morning.</p>
<p>And then I saw it.</p>
<p>The bus. Getting smaller. Disappearing down the road. The orange electric bus that I take every morning was gone. Moving away from me at a steady pace, carrying all the people who had woken up on time, who had rushed their mornings properly, who hadn&rsquo;t failed at the first task of the day.</p>
<p>I watched it disappear.</p>
<p>I hailed an auto. The auto seat was one of those old cushionless ones. Just a metal rod, wrapped in some kind of vinyl that had long since given up. As we started moving, the road underneath us was rough. Every bump, every pothole, every imperfection in the asphalt transmitted directly through the rod into my lower back.</p>
<p>I tried to tell myself: <em>It happens sometimes. It&rsquo;s okay. This is fine. You just have to keep yourself motivated. You have to find the positivity in this.</em></p>
<p>But the words felt empty. Like I was reading them off a script that someone else had written.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coaching--the-mirror">Coaching — The Mirror</h2>
<p>When I walked into the classroom, I saw my classmates.</p>
<p>Rows and rows of serious faces. Students hunched over notebooks, bent at angles that probably weren&rsquo;t good for their posture but also probably meant they were genuinely focused. Their eyes were moving across the page. Their pens were moving across the paper. There was this quiet hum of concentration in the room. The kind of hum that comes from people who know what they&rsquo;re working toward and are committed to the work.</p>
<p>And then there was me. Walking in late. Hair still slightly wet. Back sore. Shirt still sticking to my body. Defeated before the first class had even started.</p>
<p>I found my seat. Put my bag down. Tried to make myself small.</p>
<p>I looked at them—really looked at them—and I felt something settle in my chest. Not sadness. Not yet. Just the weight of clarity.</p>
<p><em>They&rsquo;re going to be ahead of me,</em> I thought. <em>I know they&rsquo;re going to be ahead of me because they&rsquo;re doing the work and I&rsquo;m not. To compete with them, I&rsquo;d have to work 10 times harder. And I can&rsquo;t even sit for 30 minutes without my mind starting to wander.</em></p>
<p>It was just an observation. A fact. But it was also devastating.</p>
<p>Our physics teacher arrived. He was carrying his notebook, the one he always carries, the one that&rsquo;s probably filled with years of notes and examples and explanations. He started teaching about gravitation. The concepts were there—rotation, circular motion, angular momentum—all the things we needed to know.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I&rsquo;d never finished the rotation chapter. Full backlog. Pages and pages of concepts I&rsquo;d never learned. So as he explained, as he built each idea on top of the previous one, I was already lost. Lost in the first five minutes.</p>
<p>I sat there, notebook open, pen in hand, copying things down without understanding them. Just moving my pen across the paper, making marks, pretending to learn. Around me, people were nodding. People were writing furious notes. People were <em>getting it</em>.</p>
<p>I felt like I was watching the lesson through glass. Present but not present. There but not there. Like I was looking at the world from behind a window that I couldn&rsquo;t break through.</p>
<p>Chemistry came next. Same feeling. Different teacher, different topic, but the same crushing sense of being left behind. Of being unable to catch up. Of being fundamentally incapable of doing what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.</p>
<p>By the time the bell rang, I was gone. Not physically—I was still sitting in my chair, still holding my pen, still in my uniform. But mentally, emotionally, I had checked out completely. I had nothing left to give. The day had already taken everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coming-home--the-collapse">Coming Home — The Collapse</h2>
<p>I came back home like a defeated junkie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to describe it. Not refreshed from a day of learning. Not energized. Not hopeful. Defeated. Empty. The kind of empty that comes from spending a whole day being reminded of your own inadequacy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep. Sleep would have required some kind of energy, some kind of will to close my eyes and surrender to unconsciousness. I didn&rsquo;t have that. Instead, I just lay down. My body on my bed. My eyes open or closed—I don&rsquo;t even remember. Just&hellip; existing. Just being present in my body without actually being conscious in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>I felt tired, but not the physical kind of tired. The emotional kind. The kind where your entire being is exhausted. Where your mind is exhausted from thinking. Where your heart is exhausted from feeling. Where your will is exhausted from trying.</p>
<p>And underneath that exhaustion was a sadness. Not sharp or acute. Just a low, constant sadness. The kind that sits in the background and colors everything. Like watching the world through grey glass.</p>
<p>Tired of the sadness. Tired of the melancholy. Tired of feeling hopeless. Tired of the endless cycle of trying and failing and promising to do better and failing again.</p>
<p>And yes, underneath all of that—something else. Something sharp. Something that was waiting. Waiting for a reason to come out. Waiting for a crack to leak through.</p>
<p>Irritation.</p>
<p>Then the sound came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s voice. The same voice that had woken me up this morning. The same voice, now asking me to do something simple. Something that should take five seconds.</p>
<p>And suddenly, everything made sense.</p>
