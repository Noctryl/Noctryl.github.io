      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom’s voice came from the kitchen, cutting through the silence of the afternoon. Sharp. Matter-of-fact. The kind of voice that doesn’t expect pushback, just compliance. I could hear the &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt; of the knife against the cutting board as she made sabji for the night. Onions, probably. The smell of them frying in hot oil drifted into the room — that acidic, pungent smell that fills the entire house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wake up, Aarav! It’s getting late for your coaching.”&#xA;The same sentence that’s echoed through my ears every morning for the past months — almost like a repeating alarm in my life. My eyelids refused to open, my body stiff. The fan above me moved lazily, stirring the air that still carried the dull warmth of the night. The blanket felt heavier than usual, trapping me in that thin line between dream and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
