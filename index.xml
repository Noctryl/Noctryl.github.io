      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-iced-tea-and-cookies&#34;&gt;The Iced Tea and Cookies&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at my desk when it struck me—how easily people describe moods as if they’re isolated, like islands floating alone. But that’s not how mine worked. Not really. Mine wasn’t a single island.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a crowd of islands, some built from my own days, my own mistakes, the pressure of expectations, and some shaped by the subtle influences of everyone around me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mood — Part Two</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;8:40 AM — This Morning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sound came before consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wake up, Aarav. It&amp;rsquo;s 8:40. You&amp;rsquo;re too late for coaching.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;rsquo;s voice. Not gentle. Not kind. Just factual. The voice of someone who has called out the same name at the same time too many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I jolted awake. The kind of jolt where your entire body tenses at once. Where adrenaline floods through you in an instant. My eyes opened but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus. The numbers on my alarm clock were swimming. 8:40. Eight. Four. Zero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mood — Part One</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Go and throw the leftover, Aarav. Lock the main door.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mom’s voice came from the kitchen, cutting through the silence of the afternoon. Sharp. Matter-of-fact. The kind of voice that doesn’t expect pushback, just compliance. I could hear the &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt; of the knife against the cutting board as she made sabji for the night. Onions, probably. The smell of them frying in hot oil drifted into the room — that acidic, pungent smell that fills the entire house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The bus.</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wake up, Aarav! It’s getting late for your coaching.”&#xA;The same sentence that’s echoed through my ears every morning for the past months — almost like a repeating alarm in my life. My eyelids refused to open, my body stiff. The fan above me moved lazily, stirring the air that still carried the dull warmth of the night. The blanket felt heavier than usual, trapping me in that thin line between dream and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing worked out the way I wanted, and I just had to get this off my chest.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sometimes, a little rant is all you need to feel lighter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
